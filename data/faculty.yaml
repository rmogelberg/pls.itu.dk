    Jesper supervises projects in the area of formal verification, focusing on ensuring the correctness of software systems. His interests include developing frameworks and tools for verifying programs, prototyping new programming languages, and applying interactive proof assistants like Coq. He encourages projects that address real-world challenges in software reliability, such as verifying critical systems or exploring the boundaries of current verification techniques. Students interested in the intersection of programming languages, formal methods, and software correctness are welcome to contact him for supervision.

    Rosario is always interested in supervising new thesis projects and welcomes students with a passion for security, privacy, and formal methods. Some example topics include: feasibility studies of typosquatting attacks in forums and Q&A websites (such as Reddit, Stack Overflow, or Quora), improving password filters by enforcing random-looking passwords, usability studies of coercion-resistant voting systems, and the design and development of secure applications for decision systems (including e-voting and exams). Other areas of interest are the design and verification of accountability systems (like Google's Certificate Transparency, Ethereum's proof-of-stake, or voting systems) and the security analysis of socio-technical systems for fun and profit (such as transport tickets, car sharing, bike rental apps, or vending machines). Students are encouraged to reach out to discuss these or other related topics.

    Willard supervises student research and thesis projects that align closely with his research interests and have the potential to result in a research publication. He is selective and only takes on projects he is highly enthusiastic about. Students interested in working with him should ensure their interests overlap with his research agenda and are encouraged to arrange a meeting to discuss potential topics. Willard’s current and past supervision covers areas such as server hardening automation, formal verification of security properties, binary analysis for vulnerabilities, automated vulnerability fixing in JavaScript libraries, emulation, privacy risk analysis, and information-flow security.
